# Kevin-s_Read_me

here is a snapshot about me, and my life

## here are some goals that I have

of course I want to learn coding, but eventually I want to keep developing my kills
after I get a high paying job I want to buy multifamily real estate and then keep buiding my investment portfolio.
Keeping on schedule while learning new skills is a challenge for me
so one of my goals is to maintain working out, and my fitness regimine while attending this class, and still educating myself when I leave
